## üõ†Ô∏è **Creating an App for Forwarder Configuration**

We need to create an app on the **Deployment Server** to manage outputs configurations for forwarders.

```bash
mkdir -p /opt/splunkforwarder/etc/deployment-apps/all_fwd_outputs/local
```

### ‚úèÔ∏è **Add Configuration**
Create an `outputs.conf` inside the app:

```ini
[tcpout]
defaultGroup = default-autolb-group

[tcpout:default-autolb-group]
server = 172.31.83.124:9997,172.31.91.156:9997,172.31.80.100:9997
```

### üîÑ **Reload Deployment Server**
Reload to push the new configuration to all forwarders:

```bash
/opt/splunk/bin/splunk reload deploy-server -class all_ufd
```

```ini
index="_internal" 
index=atlgsdach_linux_prod
```


### Windows Logs Not Showing Due to IP Configuration Issue

I encountered an issue where my Windows logs were not showing up. After troubleshooting, I discovered that the problem was caused by the IP address configuration for the indexers.

My local machine was attempting to send Windows logs to the indexers using their **private IP addresses**. However, on the deployment server, I had created an app that used the **internal IP addresses** of the indexers instead. Since the deployment server controls the configurations through the app, any manual changes I made to the configuration on the forwarder were overridden when it pulled the latest app updates.

### Solution
To resolve this, I updated the configuration to use the **public IP addresses** of the indexers instead of the internal ones. This ensures that logs are properly forwarded from my local machine to the indexers.

Here is the corrected configuration:

```plaintext
[tcpout]
defaultGroup = default-autolb-group

[tcpout:default-autolb-group]
server = <Public_IP_1>:9997,<Public_IP_2>:9997,<Public_IP_3>:9997
```

### Note
- Ensure that the deployment server's app uses the correct **public IP addresses** of the indexers.
- After making changes, run the following command to reload the deployment server and apply the new configuration:

```bash
/opt/splunk/bin/splunk reload deploy-server -class all_ufd
```

This will ensure the correct IP addresses are used and that logs from the Windows machine are successfully sent to the indexers.
