# 🔐 SIEM Role – Smart Questions to Ask Your Team (Week 1 Checklist)

### 1️⃣ ✅ Do I have the right access to all necessary systems?
Make sure you're not blocked before diving in.
- Can I access the production SIEM instance (e.g., Splunk)?

  - 📂 Jira / Ticketing tools
  - ☁️ Cloud consoles (AWS, GCP, Azure)
  - 🔧 CMDB / Asset inventory tools

### 2️⃣ 🗺️ How can I get access to infrastructure diagrams?
Understanding the environment = knowing what you're protecting.
- Where are diagrams stored? (Lucidchart, Draw.io, Confluence, etc.)
- Are there separate diagrams for:
  - 🖥️ On-prem infrastructure
  - ☁️ Cloud environments (AWS/GCP/Azure)
  - 🔄 Log ingestion pipelines (e.g., forwarders → indexers → search heads)
  - 🚦 Network segmentation / zones (DMZ, internal, prod)

### 3️⃣ 🏗️ What systems and services are currently integrated with the SIEM?
Know your log sources.
- What are we collecting from? (Firewalls, AD, DNS, EDR, VPNs, etc.)

- Are we using syslog, agents, APIs, or other methods?

### 4️⃣ 📦 Do we have a log onboarding strategy or checklist?

- What’s the process for validating log quality and completeness?

### 5️⃣ 🗓️ What’s our data retention policy?
This affects investigations and compliance.
- How long do we store logs?
- Are there compliance requirements (e.g., PCI-DSS, HIPAA, GDPR)?

### 6️⃣ 🚨 What alert rules and correlation searches are active?
Understand what threats we currently monitor.
- What types of alerts are active? (e.g., brute force, malware, privilege escalation)
- Are we using custom or out-of-the-box rules?

### 7️⃣ 😩 Are we dealing with alert fatigue or false positives?
This can impact triage and team productivity.
- Are there noisy rules being ignored?
- Is there an effort to tune or refine alerting logic?

### 8️⃣ 🧠 What detection use cases are implemented?
Map against MITRE ATT&CK or threat models.
- Which techniques or tactics do we cover?
- Which ones are in progress or planned?

### 9️⃣ 🕵️ What’s the incident response and investigation flow?
Know what happens after alerts fire.
- Who triages alerts first?
- Are we using playbooks or automation?
- How do we escalate or resolve incidents?

### 🔟 📊 What dashboards and reports are in place?
Useful for threat hunting, executive reporting, and audits.
- What dashboards do SOC analysts use daily?
- Are there executive or compliance dashboards (PCI, HIPAA, etc.)?

### 1️⃣1️⃣ 🧰 What other tools are integrated with the SIEM?
Look at the full security ecosystem.
- Are we using:
  - SOAR (automation & response)
  - Threat intelligence feeds
  - EDR, AV, cloud security tools
  - Identity providers (e.g., Okta, AD)

### 1️⃣2️⃣ 📅 What’s the roadmap or current SIEM strategy?
Get context on where things are heading.
- Any planned SIEM upgrades or migrations?
- Are there key gaps or improvements the team is working on?
