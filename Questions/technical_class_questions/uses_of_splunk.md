# Main Uses of Splunk

Here are the main things Splunk is used for:

🔍 **1. Log Management & Analysis**  
Collects logs from servers, applications, containers, firewalls, databases, and more.  
Makes it easy to search, filter, and visualize logs in real-time.  
**Example:** Troubleshooting why a web service went down by digging into NGINX or app logs.

📊 **2. Monitoring & Observability**  
Dashboards, alerts, and charts for system health, performance metrics, and resource usage.  
Used by IT and DevOps teams to monitor infrastructure, applications, and services.  
**Example:** Monitoring CPU and memory usage across AWS EC2 instances.

🛡️ **3. Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**  
Splunk Enterprise Security (ES) is a full-featured SIEM solution.  
Detects, investigates, and responds to security threats using log data.  
**Example:** Detecting suspicious login patterns or brute-force attacks.

🔔 **4. Alerting & Incident Response**  
You can set up alerts based on specific patterns or thresholds in logs or metrics.  
Can trigger actions (email, webhook, scripts) when something unusual happens.  
**Example:** Send an alert if there are too many failed login attempts in a minute.

📈 **5. Data Visualization & Reporting**  
Build interactive dashboards, reports, and graphs from raw data.  
Useful for business analytics, security reporting, or uptime summaries.  
**Example:** A dashboard showing request volumes, response times, and error rates.

📂 **6. Data Aggregation & Centralization**  
Centralizes data from multiple sources into a single place (cloud, hybrid, or on-prem).  
Makes it easier for teams to collaborate on incident resolution.  
**Example:** Combining logs from Kubernetes, Jenkins, and AWS CloudTrail into one view.

🧠 **7. Machine Learning & Anomaly Detection**  
Splunk has ML Toolkit and built-in models to detect anomalies or forecast trends.  
**Example:** Predicting spikes in traffic or catching sudden drops in sales/API responses.

🧪 **8. Audit & Compliance**  
Tracks changes, access patterns, and user activity.  
Helps meet standards like HIPAA, PCI-DSS, GDPR, etc.  
**Example:** Audit logs for who accessed sensitive customer data and when.
