# ✅ Search Head Captain Election Explained

Since you ran:

```bash
./splunk bootstrap shcluster-captain -servers_list "https://172.31.24.196:8089,https://172.31.28.177:8089,https://172.31.86.130:8089" -auth admin:splunk123
```

👉 The node you executed this command on becomes the Captain immediately after successful bootstrap but with time the captain

💡 **Why?**

- The bootstrap command triggers a captain election automatically.
- Since no other captain exists yet, the node you run it on will always win the election.
- Afterward, it will start managing:
  - 🍰 **Configuration Replication**
  - 🔄 **Rolling Restarts**
  - 🕵️‍♂️ **Search Artifact Replication**
  - 🧩 **Bundle Distribution**

- ✅ How to **force a new election** safely if needed.
- ✅ How to **check if your SHC is in a healthy state** before & after captain bootstrapping.



the majority (quorum) is always calculated as:
majority=⌊N2⌋+1
majority=⌊2N​⌋+1

So for 4 members, majority is:
⌊4/2⌋+1=2+1=3
⌊4/2⌋+1=2+1=3

Not 2.
What this means:

    To elect a captain, 3 out of 4 votes are needed.

    If all 4 members vote, the possible splits are:

        4-0 → captain elected

        3-1 → captain elected

        2-2 → tie, no captain elected

So yes, a 2-2 tie is possible, and the cluster will not elect a captain until the tie breaks (e.g., one node goes down).
So summary:
Cluster size	Majority required	Tie possible?
3	2	No (3 nodes, majority 2, no tie possible)
4	3	Yes (2-2 tie possible)
5	3	No

The key is majority is always more than half — never just half.



Scenario 1: 4-member cluster (all members up)

    Total members: 4

    Majority needed: 3 (since majority = floor(4/2) + 1 = 3)

    Possible vote splits:

        4-0 → captain elected

        3-1 → captain elected

        2-2 → tie, no captain elected

Tie is possible here because the votes can split evenly (2-2) and no one reaches majority.
Scenario 2: 5-member cluster with 1 node down (4 nodes voting)

    Total members: 5 (configured)

    Majority needed: 3 (floor(5/2) + 1 = 3)

    Nodes voting: 4 (one node down)

    Possible vote splits:

        4-0 → captain elected

        3-1 → captain elected

        2-2 → not possible, because 2 votes do NOT reach majority (3)

No tie is possible because 2 votes are less than the majority needed (3). The election either succeeds with 3 or 4 votes or fails due to lack of quorum.
Why the difference?

    The majority is based on total configured members, not just those currently online.

    In the 4-member cluster, majority is 3 out of 4, so 2-2 tie is possible.

    In the 5-member cluster, majority is 3 out of 5, so even if only 4 vote, 2-2 split doesn’t reach majority — no tie.

Summary table:
Cluster Size	Nodes Up	Majority Needed	Tie Possible?	Explanation
4	4	3	Yes	2-2 vote split causes tie
5	5	3	No	3-2 or better vote wins
5	4	3	No	2-2 not majority, no tie
