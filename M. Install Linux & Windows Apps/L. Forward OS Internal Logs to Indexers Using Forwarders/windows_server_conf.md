Git Bash for Windows provides a Bash emulation using MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows), which allows you to run Linux-like commands on Windows. However, it does not provide a full Linux environment or the ability to run native Linux binaries.

If you want a full Linux experience on Windows, you should look into:

WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) – Runs a real Linux kernel within Windows.
Cygwin – Provides a Unix-like environment but not full Linux compatibility.
Virtual Machines (VMs) with Linux – Like using VirtualBox or VMware.


Splunk Service Not Reloading Configurations
After modifying configuration files, Splunk may not automatically detect changes.
Fix:
Restart Splunk after making changes:
```powershell
net stop SplunkForwarder
net start SplunkForwarder
```
or Move to the directory, run the terminal as Admin
```sh
cd "C:\Program Files\SplunkUniversalForwarder\bin"

./splunk.exe status
```

On WSL, run the terminal as Admin
```sh
cd /mnt/c/"Program Files"/SplunkUniversalForwarder/bin

./splunk.exe status
```
