## üìä Medium Deployment Configuration
In a large deployment with **35 Indexers**, if you're using a **Search Head Cluster (SHC)**, here‚Äôs how the components fit together:

- **35 Indexers** (Clustered for redundancy)
- **3-5 Search Heads** (SHC, clustered for load balancing and high availability)
- **1 Deployer or Search Head Deployer** (To distribute configurations and apps to all the search heads in the SHC)
- **1 Cluster Master Node** (To manage the Indexer Cluster)
- **1 License Master** (To manage licensing)
- **1 Monitoring Console** (For monitoring the environment)
- **1 or 2 Heavy Forwarders** (For parsing and forwarding logs)
- **Hundreds or Thousands of Universal Forwarders** (To forward raw logs to indexers)

## üìä Large Deployment Configuration with 70 Indexers
In a large deployment with **70 Indexers**, the configuration would need to be scaled accordingly to handle the increased volume and ensure high availability, redundancy, and load balancing. Here‚Äôs how the components could fit together:

- **70 Indexers**: Clustered for redundancy and scalability to distribute workload effectively.
- **5-7 Search Heads**: Part of a Search Head Cluster (SHC) to handle increased searches, dashboards, and user queries, providing load balancing and high availability.
- **1 Deployer**: To manage the deployment of configurations and apps across all search heads in the SHC, ensuring consistency.
- **1 Cluster Master Node**: Manages the Indexer Cluster, ensuring data replication and maintaining cluster health.
- **1 License Master**: Manages licensing for the entire Splunk deployment, crucial for compliance.
- **1 Monitoring Console**: Tracks health and performance of the entire Splunk deployment.
- **2-4 Heavy Forwarders**: Handles data parsing and forwarding from source systems before sending to the indexers.
- **Thousands of Universal Forwarders**: Installed across endpoints to collect raw logs and forward them for processing.
