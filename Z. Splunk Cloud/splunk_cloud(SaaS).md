🔹 Who Provides and Manages the Forwarders in Splunk Cloud?
✅ YOU (the customer) are responsible for:

    Installing and managing Universal Forwarders (UF) or Heavy Forwarders (HF) on your own infrastructure (on-prem, cloud VMs, etc.).

    Configuring inputs using inputs.conf, props.conf, etc. on these forwarders.

    Routing and sending data to your Splunk Cloud ingestion endpoint (inputs.<region>.splunkcloud.com:9997 or via HEC).

    🔁 These forwarders are NOT part of Splunk Cloud — they are external agents that send data into Splunk Cloud.

🔹 What’s in Splunk Cloud (SaaS)?

Splunk Cloud includes only:

    Search Head(s) – for dashboards, alerts, searches

    Indexer cluster – for storing and indexing your data

    License Manager

    App support (limited)

    Ingestion endpoints (receiving data from your forwarders, HEC, etc.)

    ⚠️ There are no forwarders inside the Splunk Cloud backend. You send data to it — it does not go out and collect data like a heavy forwarder might.

🔧 Summary Chart:
Component	Included in Splunk Cloud (SaaS)?	Who Manages It?
Universal Forwarder	❌ No	✅ You (Customer)
Heavy Forwarder	❌ No	✅ You (Customer)
Search Heads	✅ Yes	☁️ Splunk Inc.
Indexers	✅ Yes	☁️ Splunk Inc.
Inputs / Monitoring	❌ No (via UFs/HFs)	✅ You
HEC / API Ingest	✅ Yes	✅ You configure via UI
Backend Configs	❌ No access	☁️ Splunk handles via support
Apps/Add-ons (limited)	✅ Web install supported	✅/☁️ Depending on plan
🧠 Real-World Example:

    You want to monitor /var/log/auth.log from 10 Linux servers:

        You install Universal Forwarders on those servers.

        You configure inputs.conf on each forwarder.

        The data is securely forwarded to your Splunk Cloud instance.

        Splunk Cloud indexes it and makes it searchable in the UI.

🔧 In Splunk Cloud (SaaS): How Do You Configure Inputs and Indexes Without Access to Config Files?

Since you don’t have backend access to configuration files like inputs.conf, indexes.conf, or system logs in Splunk Cloud, you have to use Splunk-supported alternatives:
✅ 1. Configuring Indexes (Without indexes.conf)

You cannot create or edit indexes.conf directly, but you can:
➤ Use the Splunk Support Portal or Customer Success Manager:

    Open a ticket to request new indexes or modify existing ones.

    Provide details like:

        Index name

        Retention period

        Max size / frozen time

        App context

➤ Alternatively (for some tiers of Splunk Cloud):

    Use Splunkbase Apps or admin-level web UI to request index creation (if permitted by your subscription).

    Some customers are granted partial admin capabilities, but still cannot touch indexes.conf.

✅ 2. Configuring Inputs (Without inputs.conf)

You still need to collect data—from logs, APIs, syslogs, etc. You do this using forwarders:
➤ Universal Forwarders (UFs) or Heavy Forwarders (HFs) on your servers:

    You do install these yourself.

    You configure inputs.conf locally on the forwarder (this is allowed).

    The forwarder sends data to your Splunk Cloud instance (via TLS).

    ✅ Example:

# /opt/splunkforwarder/etc/system/local/inputs.conf
[monitor:///var/log/nginx]
index = web_logs
sourcetype = nginx:access

This is how you specify which files or directories to monitor.
✅ 3. Monitoring Paths or File Ingestion

    You monitor paths on your own systems via Universal Forwarders.

    You configure the file paths, source types, and destinations (indexes) locally in the forwarder’s inputs.conf.

Splunk Cloud receives the data but doesn't directly monitor your file systems—that’s your forwarder’s job.
✅ 4. Alternatives to Forwarders

    HTTP Event Collector (HEC): Push data from apps or services to a Splunk Cloud endpoint.

    Add-ons/Apps on Search Head: Some limited input setup can be done via web UI for APIs, cloud logs (e.g., AWS CloudTrail, Azure Monitor).

🔴 Why This Limitation Exists:

Splunk Cloud runs as a multi-tenant, hardened environment:

    You don’t get shell access or backend access to ensure stability, security, and compliance.

    Infrastructure changes can only be done via Splunk’s internal tools and support.

🧠 Summary:
Task	Splunk Cloud (SaaS)
Create/Modify Index	Open support ticket
Monitor File Paths	Done via forwarder (inputs.conf on UF/HF)
Configure Inputs	Done on forwarders or via HEC
Tune Indexer Settings	Must request through support
Access inputs.conf / indexes.conf on Cloud	❌ Not permitted
