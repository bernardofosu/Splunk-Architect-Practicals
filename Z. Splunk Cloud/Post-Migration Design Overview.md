üìê Post-Migration Design Overview: Forwarder Management Architecture
üîπ Objective

Ensure that forwarders are:

    Properly configured and centrally managed

    Forwarding securely to Splunk Cloud

    Monitored for health and performance

üß© Architecture Components
‚úÖ 1. Deployment Server (DS) (On-Prem or Cloud-Hosted)

    Purpose: Manage configurations for UFs and HFs

    Location: Still hosted by you (not Splunk Cloud)

    Responsibilities:

        Distribute inputs.conf, outputs.conf, props.conf, transforms.conf

        Use server classes to apply configs to target forwarders

        Push updated apps or TA bundles to forwarders

    üîí Note: DS does not manage search heads or indexers in Splunk Cloud

‚úÖ 2. Universal Forwarders (UFs)

    Purpose: Lightweight data collection agents

    Installed On: Application servers, web servers, DBs, VMs, cloud instances

    Configuration:

        Pull config from DS (deploymentclient.conf)

        Forward data to Splunk Cloud ingestion endpoint via outputs.conf

        Encrypt traffic with TLS (SSL enabled)

    üß† Use inputs.conf for file monitoring, syslog inputs, script inputs

‚úÖ 3. Heavy Forwarders (HFs) (Optional)

    Purpose: Intermediate forwarders with parsing capabilities

    Use Cases:

        Parsing custom logs before forwarding to Splunk Cloud

        Performing modular input collection (e.g., DB Connect, REST APIs)

        Acting as data routing points (splitting data by index or sourcetype)

    Location: On-prem or cloud VM (you manage)

    Configuration:

        Pull configs from DS

        Parse/indexTime transforms if needed

        Send to Splunk Cloud ingestion endpoints securely

    ‚ö†Ô∏è Limit HF usage to specific use cases (prefer UF when parsing isn‚Äôt needed)

             (Indexers, Search Heads, etc.)

üîß Key Configs (Examples)
deploymentclient.conf (on UF/HF)

[deployment-client]
clientName = uf_server_01

[target-broker:deploymentServer]
targetUri = ds.mycompany.com:8089

outputs.conf (on UF/HF)

[tcpout]
defaultGroup = splunk-cloud

[tcpout:splunk-cloud]
server = inputs.us1.splunkcloud.com:9997
sslCertPath = $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/auth/mycert.pem
sslPassword = <encrypted>
sslRootCAPath = $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/auth/cacert.pem
sslVerifyServerCert = true

üß† Best Practices
Practice	Why It Matters
Use DS for all forwarder configs	Centralized, scalable management
Encrypt all forwarder-to-cloud traffic	Security compliance
Label forwarders with metadata (host, sourcetype, index)	Better search and routing
Monitor forwarder health (Deployment Monitor app)	Detect connection or ingestion issues
Keep forwarders updated	Ensure compatibility and security
