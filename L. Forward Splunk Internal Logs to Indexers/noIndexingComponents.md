That's correct! In a Splunk environment, the following nodes typically should not index data:

    Manager Node (Cluster Master)
        Purpose: Manages the cluster of indexers.
        Role: Distributes configuration changes and manages bucket replication.
        ‚úÖ No indexing.

    Deployer
        Purpose: Distributes configurations to search head clusters.
        Role: Ensures consistency across search heads.
        ‚úÖ No indexing.

    Search Head
        Purpose: Provides a user interface to search and analyze data.
        Role: Queries data stored in the indexers but does not store data.
        ‚úÖ No indexing. (Although some temporary data may be stored for search optimization.)

    Deployment Server
        Purpose: Manages configuration files for forwarders (especially in large environments).
        Role: Pushes configs and manages forwarder nodes.
        ‚úÖ No indexing.

    Monitoring Console
        Purpose: Monitors the health of your Splunk deployment.
        Role: Aggregates logs and metrics from all nodes.
        ‚úÖ No indexing. (It may store some performance metrics, but not log/event data.)

    License Manager
        Purpose: Manages and monitors Splunk licenses.
        Role: Ensures data ingestion stays within licensed limits.
        ‚úÖ No indexing.

üõ†Ô∏è Who Should Index Data?

    Indexers ‚Üí Store and index the incoming data. They are responsible for managing, storing, and retrieving logs when a search query is run.
    Forwarders ‚Üí Typically used to collect and send data to indexers. They do not index data but forward it instead.


Splunk clustered environment, the Deployment Server is specifically meant to manage configurations for Forwarders (Universal or Heavy), not the core components like:

    Cluster Managers (Cluster Masters)
    Indexer Cluster Peers (Search Peers)
    Search Heads (Standalone or Clustered)
    License Managers
    Monitoring Consoles

üõë Why Can't These Components Be Clients to the Deployment Server?

    Cluster Manager: It handles its own indexer configurations using replication across peers.
    Indexer Cluster Peers: Managed by the Cluster Manager, which controls configurations like indexes.conf and outputs.conf using the Cluster Bundle.
    Search Heads (Clustered): The Deployer is responsible for distributing configurations across all search head cluster members.
    License Managers & Monitoring Consoles: These are primarily management tools, not data forwarders, so they don't need to be managed by the Deployment Server.

 In a distributed environment where you're not using clustering ‚Äî meaning you have standalone components like individual search heads, indexers, or other management nodes ‚Äî then the Deployment Server can be used to manage configurations.
‚úÖ When Can Standalone Components Be Clients to a Deployment Server?

    If the components are not part of a cluster (e.g., not managed by a Cluster Manager or Deployer).
    If you are using a distributed environment where indexers and search heads are independent.
    If you need to manage the configurations of multiple independent search heads, indexers, or other Splunk components.

In this case, the Deployment Server can distribute the outputs.conf or any other configuration files (like inputs.conf, props.conf, or transforms.conf) to those components.
üöÄ Example Scenarios Where This Works

    Standalone Indexers not in a cluster.
    Standalone Search Heads running independently.
    Forwarders (both Universal and Heavy) are common clients.
    Monitoring Consoles if you want centralized management.

üîé How to Configure Standalone Components as Deployment Clients

    Enable Deployment Client on the Component
    On the standalone node (e.g., a search head or indexer), configure the deploymentclient.conf file:

sudo vi /opt/splunk/etc/system/local/deploymentclient.conf

Add the following:

[deployment-client]
disabled = false

[target-broker:deploymentServer]
targetUri = http://<deployment-server-ip>:8089

    Replace <deployment-server-ip> with the actual IP or hostname of your deployment server.

    Restart Splunk

splunk restart

    Create a Server Class on the Deployment Server

    Go to Settings ‚Üí Forwarder Management in Splunk Web.
    Create a new Server Class and add your standalone components to it.

    Deploy Configuration

    Place the outputs.conf in the appropriate app directory on the Deployment Server (e.g., /opt/splunk/etc/deployment-apps/my_app/local/outputs.conf).
    Apply the configuration using the Deployment Server.

‚ö†Ô∏è Why Not Use Deployment Server for Clustered Components?

    Indexers in a Cluster: Managed by the Cluster Manager.
    Search Heads in a Cluster: Managed by the Deployer.
    License Managers and Cluster Managers: Manage their own configurations and are not meant to be managed by a Deployment Server.

For large environments, automation with Ansible or similar tools is the best option to ensure consistent and scalable management of your configs.
