# ✅ What This `curl` Command Does

```sh
curl -k -u admin:changeme https://<MC>:8089/services/data/inputs/monitoringconsole/discovered_hosts \
 -d name=<peer_fqdn_or_ip>:8089 \
 -d server_roles=indexer \
 -d site=site1
```

## ✔️ What Happens When You Run This?
This command updates the **Monitoring Console (MC)** by:

- 📌 **Registering the given peer** (`name=<peer>:8089`) as a known Splunk component.
- 📌 **Assigning a role** to the peer (`server_roles=indexer`), which can be indexer, search_head, license_master, etc.
- 📌 **Setting a site** (`site=site1`) if using multisite clustering (optional).
- 📌 **Making it visible** under `MC -> Settings -> Monitoring Console -> Settings -> General Setup` as a discovered host.

## ✅ What If You Want To Do Something Else?
| **Goal** | **Solution** |
|------------|-------------|
| Make MC know about the peer | Use `curl` to `/monitoringconsole/discovered_hosts` |
| Make Search Heads (SHs) know about indexers (search peers) | Update `distsearch.conf` |
| Make forwarders send logs to indexers | Update `outputs.conf` |
| Make nodes join the cluster | Update `server.conf` with `[clustering]` stanza |

---

## 🟣 Pro Tip: How This Is Done in Production
In enterprise environments, Splunk admins usually:

- 🚀 **Deploy `distsearch.conf` automatically** to SHs via **Deployer**.
- 🚀 **Deploy `outputs.conf` automatically** to Forwarders via **Deployment Server (DS)**.
- 🚀 **Let MC auto-discover peers** via **Cluster Master, DS, or this REST API (`curl`)**.

---

## ✅ Answering Your Key Question:
❌ **No, this `curl` command does NOT add search peers for the Search Heads.**
✅ **It only tells the Monitoring Console that this peer exists and should be monitored.**

Would you like to see:
- ✅ The **REST API equivalent** for adding Search Peers to a Search Head programmatically?
- ✅ A **fully automated solution** that registers:
  - Search Peers
  - MC Peers
  - Complete deployment via DS and Deployer?

This will give you a **💎 rock-solid Splunk Enterprise setup**.

## 💡 Behind-the-Scenes: How Splunk Discovery Works

🔍 **When you run:**
```sh
curl -k -u admin:changeme https://<MC>:8089/services/data/inputs/monitoringconsole/discovered_hosts
```

💡 **You are actually doing two things:**

1. **Creating a "search peer" entry** inside the MC’s `distsearch.conf`.
2. **Allowing MC to discover this peer** before it appears in Monitoring Console → Distributed Environment → Instances.

### ✅ Official Confirmation: Even the Monitoring Console is a Search Head!
The **Monitoring Console (MC) is technically a Search Head** in Splunk's architecture because:

- ✅ It **has a `distsearch.conf`** like a normal SH.
- ✅ It **connects to "search peers"** (indexers, SHs, etc.).
- ✅ It **pulls introspection data** (internal logs, health checks, etc.).

🔹 **Therefore, the curl command adds a search peer to the MC, allowing it to monitor that peer’s internal logs.**

---

## ✅ Splunk Components & Their Search Peer Needs
| **Component** | **Needs Search Peers?** | **Why?** |
|--------------|----------------|-------------------------------|
| 🔵 **Search Head (SH)** | ✅ Yes | To distribute searches to indexers |
| 🟢 **Monitoring Console (MC)** | ✅ Yes | To pull monitoring data from nodes |
| 🟠 **Deployer** | ❌ No | Does not perform searches |
| 🟣 **Cluster Master (CM)** | ❌ No | Manages indexer cluster, no searching |

### ✅ Corrected Explanation:
🔹 This `curl` command **updates the Monitoring Console's list of search peers**.
🔹 It **does NOT update the main Search Head’s `distsearch.conf`**.
🔹 To manage Search Peers for SHs, you still need to modify `distsearch.conf` separately.

## ✅ Goal:

| Task | Automated? | Method |
|------|------------|--------|
| Auto-register peers into MC (Monitoring Console) | ✅ | REST API + `inputs.conf` discovery |
| Auto-configure search peers on Search Heads | ✅ | Deploy `distsearch.conf` via Deployer |
| Auto-configure forwarders to Indexers | ✅ | Deploy `outputs.conf` via Deployment Server |
| Auto-join nodes into Clusters | ✅ | `server.conf` + `clustering` app |

# 💡 Step 1 - Auto Discovery to MC without curl (Recommended)

### Option 1️⃣ - Passive Discovery (preferred in Splunk ≥ 9.x)

- MC will auto-discover:
    - Peers in the **Indexer Cluster** via CM REST.
    - SH in the **SHC** via Deployer or SH itself.
    - Any connected node that has `introspection` data exposed.

✅ Requirement:
Make sure all nodes have:
```ini
[settings]
serverName = <hostname>
```
And that MC's `server.conf` has:
```ini
[clustering]
mode = searchhead
master_uri = https://<CM>:8089
```
Once MC is aware of the CM, it pulls peer lists automatically! No need for curl.

### Option 2️⃣ - Automated curl via setup.sh

If you want to still automate `curl`, create a lightweight bash script like:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
for peer in 172.31.80.100 172.31.91.156 172.31.83.124; do
  curl -k -u admin:changeme https://<MC>:8089/services/data/inputs/monitoringconsole/discovered_hosts \
   -d name=${peer}:8089 \
   -d server_roles=indexer \
   -d site=site1
done
```

Deploy this script once during initial bootstrap.

# 💡 Step 2 - Search Peers Automation for Search Heads

✅ `distsearch.conf` via Deployer

Create `$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/shcluster/apps/_cluster_search_peers/default/distsearch.conf`

```ini
[distributedSearch]
servers = site1_indexer_01:8089, site1_indexer_02:8089, site1_indexer_03:8089, indexer_01_Site2:8089, indexer_02_Site2:8089, indexer_03_Site2:8089
```

Then push it:

```bash
splunk apply shcluster-bundle -target https://<SH>:8089 -auth admin:changeme
```

---

# 💡 Step 3 - Forwarders Automation

✅ `outputs.conf` via Deployment Server

In your Deployment App:

```ini
[tcpout]
defaultGroup = auto_indexers
forwardedindex.filter.disable = true
indexAndForward = false

[tcpout:auto_indexers]
server = 172.31.80.100:9997,172.31.91.156:9997,172.31.83.124:9997,172.31.28.248:9997
```

This gets pushed automatically to all Forwarders.

---

# 💡 Step 4 - Cluster Member Automation

✅ `server.conf` in an app via DS or manually

```ini
[clustering]
master_uri = https://172.31.92.30:8089
mode = peer
pass4SymmKey = MySuperSecretKey
site = site1
```

---

# ✅ Real Pro Tips:

| ✅ Best Practice | 💼 Use Deployment Server for Forwarders only |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------|
| 💼 Use Deployer for Search Head Cluster apps | 💼 Use CM to control Indexer Cluster |
| 💼 Use Monitoring Console to auto-discover peers via CM |

---

# 💎 Real Automation Flow

1️⃣ **Deployment Server:** pushes forwarder configs (`outputs.conf`, `inputs.conf`)
2️⃣ **Deployer:** pushes `distsearch.conf` to SHC members
3️⃣ **Cluster Master:** handles Indexer Cluster membership
4️⃣ **Monitoring Console:** discovers everything automatically
