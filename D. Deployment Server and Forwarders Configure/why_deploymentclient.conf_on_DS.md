# 📌 Importance of `[deployment-client]` in Splunk Deployment Server

## 🔹 Why `[deployment-client]` Should Be on the Deployment Server?

When setting up a **Splunk Deployment Server**, ensuring it also has the `[deployment-client]` configuration is critical for smooth migrations and automatic reconnections. Here’s why:

### 1️⃣ **Automatic Reconnection on Migration**
- If you **replace the Deployment Server** but keep the **same DNS name**, all clients (including the server itself) will **reconnect automatically**.
- This prevents manual reconfiguration and ensures **continuous deployment** of apps.

### 2️⃣ **Ensuring the Deployment Server Manages Its Own Apps**
- Some **deployment apps** might need to be applied to the **Deployment Server itself**.
- By configuring it as a **client of itself**, the Deployment Server will pull these apps automatically.

### 3️⃣ **Disaster Recovery & High Availability**
- If the original Deployment Server **fails**, a new one can be created with the **same DNS name**.
- Clients and the Deployment Server itself will **automatically reconnect**, ensuring no downtime.

## ✅ **Best Practice Configuration**
To ensure **smooth migration & auto-reconnect**, add this to **`/opt/splunk/etc/system/local/deploymentclient.conf`** on the **Deployment Server itself**:

```ini
[deployment-client]

[target-broker:deploymentServer]
targetUri = https://splunk-deploy.example.com:8089  # Use DNS Name
```

### 🔹 **Why Use DNS Instead of IP?**
- If the Deployment Server changes **(e.g., new instance, failover, or upgrade)**, clients **don’t need to update their config**.
- They will automatically reconnect to the new Deployment Server using the **same DNS name**.

---

## 🔥 **Final Takeaways**
✅ **Deployment Clients (Forwarders)** → Use `[deployment-client]` to connect to the Deployment Server.
✅ **Deployment Server itself** → Should also have `[deployment-client]` to ensure it re-registers automatically when migrated or replaced.
✅ **Use a DNS Name** → Ensures clients and the Deployment Server always reconnect, even if the server instance changes.
